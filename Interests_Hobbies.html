            <h3> Formula 1 </h3>
            <div class ="side">
            <p> I’ve been obsessed with Formula 1 for as long as I can remember. I support Ferrari, 
                although they constantly test my patience, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. 
                This season, I’ve been keeping a close eye on drivers like Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz, 
                Yuki Tsunoda, and Isack Hadjar. There’s something really exciting about the mix of strategy, 
                speed and unpredictability that makes every race feel like an event. Whether it's a chaotic 
                street circuit or a classic like Spa, I love following every moment.</p>

            <h3> Football </h3>
            <div class="side">
            <p> Football is another big part of my life. I’m a Chelsea fan through and through, 
                even when we’re struggling in the league. My favourite player of all time has to be
                 Eden Hazard - no one could glide across the pitch quite like he did. Watching 
                 Chelsea play has become a bit of a tradition in my week, and I love how football 
                 brings people together, whether it's watching games with friends or debating 
                 line-ups online.</p>

            <h3> Reading </h3>
            <div class="side">
            <p>I also love to read. There’s nothing quite like getting lost in a good book.
                 I’m always looking for recommendations and love sharing what I’ve read too.
                 You can follow me on Fable to see my latest reads and reviews. So far, my 
                 favourite book this year has been The Nightingale - it’s emotional, beautifully
                 written and has stuck with me long after I finished it.</p>
