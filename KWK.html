                    <h2>Data Science Scholar</h2>
                    <small>June 2023</small>
                    <p> I joined Kode With Klossy as a Data Science scholar, where I explored Python, 
                        SQL, and data visualisation. It was my first hands-on experience using tech to
                        tackle real-world issues - I built a data-driven platform addressing food 
                        insecurity in Kenya. This experience sparked my passion for data science 
                        and its potential to drive impact.</p>

                    <h2>Website Development Scholar</h2>
                    <small>July 2024</small>
                    <p> In 2024, I returned to KWK as a Web Development scholar, learning HTML, CSS, 
                        and JavaScript. I developed a portfolio-building site for students navigating 
                        university applications, combining my love for education and tech to create 
                        meaningful tools for others.</p>

                    <p> Later that year, I was selected as a KWK Community Ambassador. I designed 
                        digital content to spotlight underrepresented women in STEM and led initiatives 
                        to empower more girls to explore tech. This role helped me grow as both a creator 
                        and a community leader.</p>

                    <p> As an IA, I support scholars across three virtual Data Science camps. I lead breakout 
                        rooms, guide code-alongs, and help students bring their final projects to life. Being 
                        able to mentor and uplift scholars in the same environment where my own journey began 
                        is incredibly meaningful.</p>

                    <p> Currently, I’m participating in the KWK x BWDC Challenge, pushing my creativity and technical 
                        skills even further. It’s a space where I can collaborate with an inspiring community and continue
                         building tech that empowers, uplifts, and inspires change.</p>
